General Description

The player is assigned a color that initially matches the platform it starts on. There will be different color shifters and different color platforms on the way. When a player walks/jumps through a color shifter, the character’s color changes to that specific color enabling it to “blend in”. The player needs to avoid mismatching its character’s color to the platform's color while steering clear of other obstacles and making it to the endpoint to move on to the next level. 

Goal

The goal is to match the player's color with the platform (and at the same time avoid other obstacles) and reach the endpoint.
Mechanics (How to play)
Player moves: Keyboard keys ‘A/Left’ and ‘D/Right’ to move left and right; ‘W/SpaceBar’ to jump.
Color change: Change character color when it walks/jumps through a color shifter.
Color match: Match the character color to the platform. If it matches, the game continues; else the player loses.

Inspiration

Platformer: Mario, Vector, Mr. Jump
Color Change/Match: Color Ball Run, Color Switch
